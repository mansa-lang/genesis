This repository is **Genesis**; the fast, pragmatic Python prototype whose sole purpose is to compile the **true**, self-hosted Mansa compiler as quickly and correctly as possible.

When Mansa compiles itself, this repository will be archived in eternal honor, and the empire will stand sovereign.

**P**roductivity · **E**fficiency · **R**eliability · **F**lexibility · **E**xpressiveness · **C**orrectness · **T**imeliness
