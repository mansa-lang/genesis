# Mansa Genesis

> **The stage-0 bootstrapper that will birth the self-hosted Mansa Toolchain**

This repository is **Genesis**; the fast, pragmatic Python prototype whose sole purpose is to compile the **true**, self-hosted Mansa compiler as quickly and correctly as possible.

When Mansa compiles itself, this repository will be archived in eternal honor, and the empire will stand sovereign.
